# Royal Holloway Licence

This repository is designed to assist students of Royal Holloway Computer Science Department who wish to publish, open source or otherwise distribute work they have completed as part of their course. It is designed to be read alongside the [Student Handbook](https://intranet.royalholloway.ac.uk/computerscience/informationforcurrentstudents/home.aspx) and the [College Regulations on Academic Misconduct](https://intranet.royalholloway.ac.uk/staff/teaching/aqpo/academic-regulations-and-policies/academic-regulations-and-policies.aspx).

## Why? 

Students put a lot of work into designing creative assignment submissions and producing interesting and original work. When looking to further their academic career or apply for jobs, it is important they are able to showcase the work they have done. 
Equally, it is important for the Department and College to protect the integrity of the degree and to ensure a level playing field for all. 

The College does not claim ownership of, or any rights to non-assesed work product produced by the student as part of their degree. The Student retains full ownership and rights to the work they produce outside of assignments. 

This repository contains several template licences, which are explained later on. The README includes general advice and best practices to avoid allegations of Academic Misconduct. It is important to note that information contained within this repository is unofficial and provides no gurantee against and should not be used as a defence for allegations of Academic Misconduct. 

## Best Practice
- Do not publish assesed work unless this has been agreed with the department. 
- If publishing work connected to, but not directly associated with, assesments you should only publish after grades for that asssesment have been returned.
- Ensure you do not publish code skeletons, documentation or any material provided directly to you by the course leader. This remains the Copyright of the College and a licence to reproduce it should be sort if you wish to do so. 
- Always publish work with a specific licence. Although no licence technically indicates no rights to the reader it is better to state this explicitly for the avoidence of doubt. 
- If you are publishing "solutions" to an assignment or labsheet, it is adviseable to include the below [disclaimer](#disclaimer).
- When publishing group work, you must have the conset of all parties and they should be named on the licence. 
- If you use Git remotes as a back up tool, ensure you understand whether the remote is set as public or private. 

## Disclaimer
